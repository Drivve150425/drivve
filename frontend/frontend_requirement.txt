1. User Profile Creation:
   - Input fields: First Name, Last Name, Email, Date of Birth, Gender, Country, State, City, Referral Code.
   - Profile picture selection: Upload from gallery, take photo, or select avatar.
   - Date of Birth picker with age validation (minimum 18 years).
   - Gender selection modal with options: Male, Female, Prefer Not to Say.
   - Country fixed to "India" with local JSON data for states and cities.
   - State and City selection modals populated from local JSON file (india_states_cities.json).
   - Validation for required fields and proper formats.

2. Email Verification with OTP:
   - "Verify" button inside email input field to send OTP.
   - OTP input field appears after sending OTP.
   - Submit OTP to verify email.
   - API endpoints:
     - POST /emailapi/send-email-otp/
     - POST /emailapi/verify-email-otp/
   - Frontend API service updated to call these endpoints.
   - Validation for email format and OTP length.
   - UI feedback for OTP sent, verification success, and errors.

3. UI Components and Libraries:
   - React Native components: TextInput, TouchableOpacity, Modal, FlatList, ScrollView, SafeAreaView.
   - Expo libraries:
     - expo-image-picker
     - expo-linear-gradient
     - react-native-modal-datetime-picker
   - React Native Vector Icons:
     - @expo/vector-icons (Ionicons, MaterialIcons)
   - DateTimePickerModal for date selection.

4. Known Issues and Recommendations:
   - iOS devices show "TypeError: property is not configurable" related to FlatList and Hermes engine.
   - Suggested disabling Hermes engine on iOS for testing.
   - Defensive copying of arrays before passing to FlatList to avoid rendering issues.
   - Use unique keys for FlatList items (state or city names).

5. API Base URLs and Backend Integration:
   - Backend server running at http://localhost:8000.
   - Ensure backend email verification API is running and accessible.
   - Frontend app config updated with correct API base URL.
